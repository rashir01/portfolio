## Nav Bar
The nav bar is responsive

The navbar will indicate the item that is being hovered over

## Home Section
Includes a current picture and intro 

used flex to arrange the elements in a column

## About section

## Projects Section
The projects will show a static image when hovering on them

## Contact me
Currently this is a placeholder that does not have my real email. It will be replaced with a form once I learn JS.
